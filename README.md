📊 Food Marketing Analytics — Customer Segmentation
End-to-end marketing analytics project focused on customer value segmentation and data-driven targeting decisions.
🚀 Why This Project

Marketing teams often run blanket campaigns without knowing:

💰 Who actually drives revenue

🛒 Which products and channels matter most

🎯 Which customers should (or should not) be targeted

This project solves that problem using EDA + customer segmentation.

🧠 What I Did (Quick Scan)

✅ Cleaned and engineered customer features (Age, Total Spend, Recency, Household)
✅ Performed focused EDA to identify revenue and behavior patterns
✅ Segmented customers using K-Means
✅ Translated clusters into business-ready personas
✅ Visualized insights clearly for decision-makers

📊 Key Insights (What Matters to Business)

💎 Customer value is highly skewed — a small segment drives most revenue

🍷 Wines & Meat Products dominate spending

🏬🌐 Store and Web are the primary purchase channels

📬 Campaign responders consistently show higher total spend

These insights justify segment-based marketing over mass campaigns.

🧩 Customer Segments Identified
Segment	Business Meaning
⭐ High-Value Loyalists	Core revenue drivers; high income & spend
🚀 Aspirational Spenders	Mid-value, promotion-sensitive
📱 Convenience-Oriented Shoppers	Under-monetized; high upside
🧊 Low-Value / Entry Customers	Low spend; low marketing ROI

Clusters are statistically distinct and visually validated.

📌 Business Recommendations

🎯 Prioritize High-Value Loyalists for retention & premium campaigns

📈 Grow Convenience-Oriented Shoppers via personalization

🎁 Target Aspirational Spenders selectively with promotions

🚫 Suppress costly campaigns for Low-Value / Entry Customers
